# Simple Token Authentication with Java
 
An example app that shows you how to do token authentication with Java and Spring Boot.

Please read [Simple Token Authentication for Java Apps](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/10/16/2018-10-16-token-auth-for-java) to see how this app was created.

**Prerequisites:** [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

## Getting Started

To install this example application, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-token-auth-example.git
cd okta-spring-boot-token-auth-example
```

This will get a copy of the project installed locally. To install all of its dependencies and start the app, run:
 
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

### Create an Application in Okta

You will need to [create an OpenID Connect Application in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/09/26/build-a-spring-boot-webapp#set-up-okta-for-oauth-20-single-sign-on) to get your values to perform authentication. 

Log in to your Okta Developer account (or [sign up](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) if you don’t have an account) and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Web**, click **Next**, give the app a name you’ll remember, and select "Client Credentials". Click **Done** and copy the `clientId` and `clientSecret` into `src/main/resources/application.yml`. 

```yaml
server:  
  port: 8080  
                                         
okta:  
  oauth2: 
    issuer: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default  
    clientId: {yourClientId}
    clientSecret: {yourClientSecret}
```

**NOTE:** The value of `{yourOktaDomain}` should be something like `dev-123456.oktapreview`. Make sure you don't include `-admin` in the value!

After modifying this file, restart your app and you should be able to authenticate with an access token. Please read the [companion blog post](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/10/16/2018-10-16-token-auth-for-java) for additional information.
